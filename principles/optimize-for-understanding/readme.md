Optimize for Understanding
--------------------------

---

A [Microsoft survey](devtime-preprint-TSE19.pdf) finds roughly 15% of engineer time is spent actually writing code. That increases to 30% if count fixing bugs, which I'd argue should not count as the efficacy relies on being able to understand code that already exists. The point here is, the majority of the value engineers bring is their ability to understand the problem space and how their system solves that problem.

However, the survey also finds that engineers prefer days where they get to write code (a _good day_ is 18% coding, a _bad day_ is 11% coding). To have more _good days_, time must be taken from other parts of the job, so from these meetings, etc, where the engineers' understanding of the system is necessary. One way to take time from those is to ensure the system is _easier_ to understand, thus explaining it, or solving new problems in the domain are less time consuming.

So, be selfish. Make your system simple. Avoid promotion oriented design.

Code is for humans, not for computers.
