This is a reference to the phrase *[turtles all the way down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down)*. The phrase refers to the myth of a world turtle, where earth exists on the back of a turtle. That turtle then sits on the back of another turtle, who is chilling out on another turtle... and so on.  
As a resident of the turtle, you don‚Äôt need to care about the turtle, or how it goes about it‚Äôs life ‚Äî you just live your own life. This is what a good software abstraction can bring, I don‚Äôt need to care about the rest of the world, I just live my life; deal with the problem directly at hand and nothing else. Good software will be *turtles all the way down*.

I wrote an entire talk semi-related to this, [Quality Qualities](/talks/quality-qualities/).
